**Assignment: Build a Mini Subscription Service API**

**Objective:**  
Design and implement a simple backend service for managing user subscriptions, focusing on code quality, architecture, best practices and documentation.

**Requirements:**  
- Use Java (Spring / Spring Boot or similar framework).
- Implement endpoints to:
    - Register a new customer.
    - Allow a customer to subscribe or unsubscribe to a product (e.g., a digital newspaper).
    - Retrieve a customerâ€™s current subscriptions.
- Store data in-memory (no need for a database).
- Include basic authentication (e.g., API key or token, can be mocked).
- Write a concise README explaining:
    - Your architectural decisions.
    - How to run and test the solution.

**Optional if time permits:**  
- Use a database
- Add a simple frontend to demonstrate basic subscription flows.
- Create a Dockerfile

**Time frame:**  
Spend a maximum of 3-4 hours. It's not necessary to implement every feature completely. Focus on quality, clarity, and communication of your approach.

**Delivery:**  
- As a git repository or zipped and sent by mail.
- Add a few lines about what you could have done better if you had the time.

Good luck!
