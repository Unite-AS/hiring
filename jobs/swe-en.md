## About Unite

Unite was formed in the summer of 2024, initially as a merger of the development departments of Mentor Medier and Mediaconnect. In the summer of 2025, the company became complete when the rest of Mediaconnect, including support and customer service, also became part of Unite. We have long-standing experience delivering subscription systems to Norwegian newspapers, and we own and continue to develop the well-known Connect system in addition to several newly developed solutions.

The media houses in our group are Morgenbladet, Vårt Land, Dagsavisen, Klar Tale, and Dagen in Sweden. We also have many external customers, including Aller Media, Egmont, Klassekampen, Hegnar Media, Flowy in Sweden, and dozens of other publications.

Several of us in the company have experience from some of Norway's largest media houses, such as VG and Dagbladet, and we have developers with special expertise in user payments and subscriptions.

Our main products today consist of subscription systems, login and purchase flows, campaign management, and news apps. We've noticed that our technology is getting a lot of attention in the industry, and we need to scale up new technology, modernize parts of our product portfolio, and develop entirely new products to achieve our goal of becoming a leader in our field in the Nordics.
