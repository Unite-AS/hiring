# Unite is looking for a new Software Engineer

Unite is a company owned by Mentor Medier. We create products for the media industry, with a primary focus on login, purchasing, and subscriptions. We are passionate about building products that are easy to use and create real value for our customers. We believe the key to success is working in a user-centric and data-driven way.

With new products heading to market and new customers coming on board, we need another software engineer to join our team.

We are looking for a person who can help build our core product and get us ready for future growth.

## We are looking for someone with

- Extensive experience building scalable backend architectures using Node.js and Nest.js, with a strong focus on clean code and best practices.
- Deep technical knowledge of OAuth2 and OIDC flows, with the ability to architect secure login, session management, and authentication systems.
- Proficiency in modern frontend development using frameworks such as Next.js/Nuxt to build fast and responsive user experiences.
- Experience with (or a strong understanding of) subscriptions, payment gateways, and transaction handling.
- A proactive mindset that dares to challenge established truths.
- Experience with React Native and Expo is a significant plus, but not a requirement.
- The ability to bridge the gap between technical complexity and business needs, communicating solutions clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
- A results-oriented approach driven by creating value, with a sense of ownership over the product from code to deployment.
- Experience with CI/CD pipelines.
- A genuine desire to learn and grow professionally within a hybrid work environment.

We offer you an energetic and results-oriented environment with a high level of commitment, competitive terms, and cozy offices in central Oslo with a flexible and hybrid work schedule.

We have customers in Norway and Sweden, and we have big ambitions for the coming years. Our typical customers are media houses such as Morgenbladet, Klassekampen, Vårt Land, Hegnar Media, Aller Media, Dagsavisen, as well as several other large and small media companies.

We are focused on gaining new market shares in Scandinavia and see this position as critical to ensuring continued growth. We are a B2B SaaS provider, and we work closely with newspapers' readers to ensure we create software that media houses succeed with.

We offer the right candidate the opportunity to be part of an exciting journey in what we believe is one of the most important industries right now—never has free and independent journalism been more crucial, and digital subscriptions are emerging as the most important revenue stream for the media industry.

You will have the opportunity to make a difference in an environment that works closely with the media houses in our shared Mentor Medier group, with new offices in central Oslo. We place a high value on professional and personal development and are committed to building a culture where everyone contributes their best to achieve common goals, helps each other, and has the chance to develop where they are strongest. Here, you get the chance to work on challenging issues and become part of a team driven by creating results.

Our new software engineer will report to the CTO.

Could you be the person we're looking for? Please contact CTO Bjarne Øverli at **bjarne[at]unite.as**.

## About Unite

Unite was formed in the summer of 2024, initially as a merger of the development departments of Mentor Medier and Mediaconnect. In the summer of 2025, the company became complete when the rest of Mediaconnect, including support and customer service, also became part of Unite. We have long-standing experience delivering subscription systems to Norwegian newspapers, and we own and continue to develop the well-known Connect system in addition to several newly developed solutions.

The media houses in our group are Morgenbladet, Vårt Land, Dagsavisen, Klar Tale, and Dagen in Sweden. We also have many external customers, including Aller Media, Egmont, Klassekampen, Hegnar Media, Flowy in Sweden, and dozens of other publications.

Several of us in the company have experience from some of Norway's largest media houses, such as VG and Dagbladet, and we have developers with special expertise in user payments and subscriptions.

Our main products today consist of subscription systems, login and purchase flows, campaign management, and news apps. We've noticed that our technology is getting a lot of attention in the industry, and we need to scale up new technology, modernize parts of our product portfolio, and develop entirely new products to achieve our goal of becoming a leader in our field in the Nordics.
